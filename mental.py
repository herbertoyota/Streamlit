        "This dataset provides valuable insights into mental health conditions, stress levels, and associated lifestyle factors across different occupations and countries."
        "It includes a wide array of variables that allow for in-depth analysis and understanding of how various factors influence mental well-being.\n\n"
        "To derive insights from this project, I posed the following questions: \n\n"
        
        "- **Distribution of Sleep Hours, Work Hours, and Physical Activity Hours:**\n\n"
        "  - How do individuals allocate their time across these activities, and what patterns emerge in different populations?\n\n"
               
        "\n- **Average of sleep hours, work hours, and physical activity hours by:**\n\n"
        "  - **Mental Condition:** How does mental health status (e.g., anxiety, depression) correlate with lifestyle factors?\n"
        "  - **Consultation History:** Does seeking professional help influence mental health and lifestyle factors?\n"
        "  - **Stress Level:** How do individuals with varying stress levels (low, medium, high) distribute their time?\n"
        "  - **Severity:** How does the severity of a mental health condition impact daily routines?\n"
        "  - **Country:** Are there geographical differences in lifestyle patterns and mental health conditions?\n"
        "  - **Occupation:** Does one's occupation influence their mental health and daily routines?\n\n"

        "\n- **Proportion of Stress Level and Severity by:**\n\n"
        "  - **Mental Condition:** Are certain mental conditions more strongly associated with high stress levels?\n"
        "  - **Consultation History:** Do those with a history of consultation report different stress levels compared to others?\n"
        "  - **Stress Level:** How is stress distributed across different conditions and demographics?\n"
        "  - **Severity:** How do different severities of mental conditions correlate with stress levels?\n"
        "  - **Country:** Are there country-specific trends in stress and severity of conditions?\n"
        "  - **Occupation:** How do different occupations correlate with stress and severity levels?\n\n"
