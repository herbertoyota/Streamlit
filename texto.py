        "\n**Details of the project:** https://nbviewer.org/github/herbertoyota/proj5/blob/70ac27cf75d99b97520ad1131f35b7f0275d9dec/car_accidednts-.ipynb\n\n"
        "In this analysis, the primary goal was to conduct a comprehensive comparison of the total number of accidents and the percentage of fatal accidents (calculated as deaths per accident) across several dimensions. "
        "This study aims to uncover insights related to both the frequency and severity of accidents based on various factors. \n\n"
        
        "**Total Number of Accidents by Various Factors:**\n\n"
        
        "The analysis first examines the total number of accidents by breaking down occurrences across several key factors. These factors include:\n\n"
        
        "- **Time**: The total number of accidents is analyzed over time to detect trends and fluctuations. This includes examining how accidents change yearly, the seasonality of accidents (which months have higher or lower accident rates), variations across weekdays, and peak hours where accidents are more likely to occur.\n\n"
            
        "- **State and City**: Observing the distribution of accidents across different states and cities helps identify regions with higher risks, possibly due to population density, road conditions, or other factors.\n\n"
        
        "- **Weather Timestamp and Weather Condition**: Analyzing the impact of weather on accidents, with data on the time of weather events and specific weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog, snow). This analysis can determine if adverse weather increases accident likelihood.\n\n"
        
        "- **Road Characteristics**: Assessing how road infrastructure influences accident rates, considering road types (e.g., simple, double), delineation(e.g., bridge,curve) and directions (e.g., increasing,decreasing).\n\n"
        
        "- **Top 10 Cause of Accident and Type of Accident**: Identifying the most common causes and types of accidents, helping to understand prevalent risk factors and scenarios.\n\n"
        
        "- **Vehicles Involved**: Analyzing accidents based on the types and numbers of vehicles involved, providing insights into which vehicle types are most commonly associated with accidents.\n\n"
        
        "**Percentage of Fatal Accidents (Deaths per Accident) by Various Factors:**\n\n"
        
        "In addition to the total number of accidents, the analysis includes a breakdown of fatal accidents by deaths per accident across the same factors. "
        "Each factor provides insights into where fatal accidents are more likely to occur and under what conditions:\n\n"
        
        "- **Time**: Evaluating fatal accident rates by year, month, weekday, and hour to identify when accidents are most severe.\n"
        "- **Location** (State): Highlighting states with a higher proportion of fatal accidents, which may require targeted safety interventions.\n"
        "- **Weather Conditions**: Exploring the correlation between weather events and fatal accident rates.\n"
        "- **Road Characteristics**: Assessing the types of roads and directions associated with higher fatality rates.\n"
        "- **Top 10 Causes**: Focusing on the most dangerous accident causes and types in terms of fatality rates.\n\n"
        
        "**Methodology and Tools Used:**\n\n"
        
        "To conduct this analysis, I used the Python library Pandas for data manipulation and analysis."
        "For visualization, I employed Plotly Express, which allowed me to create clear and interactive charts, making it easier to visualize patterns and relationships within the data.\n\n"
